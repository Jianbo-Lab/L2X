# L2X 

Code for replicating the experiments in the paper [Learning to
Explain: An Information-Theoretic Perspective on Model
Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07814.pdf) at ICML 2018, by Jianbo
Chen, Mitchell Stern, Martin J. Wainwright, Michael I. Jordan.

## Dependencies
The code for L2X runs with Python and requires Tensorflow of version 1.2.1 or higher and Keras of version 2.0 or higher. Please `pip install` the following packages:
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow` 
- `keras`
- `pandas`
